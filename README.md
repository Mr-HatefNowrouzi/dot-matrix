# 8x8 Dot Matrix Display with AVR

This project uses **three push buttons**, an **8Ã—8 dot matrix**, and an **AVR microcontroller** to implement various display effects, including:

- **Pendulum effect**  
- **Circular rotation of dots**  
- **Scrolling numbers horizontally and vertically**  
- **LEDs turning on/off during number counting**  

## Button Control

All display modes are controlled using the three push buttons. The modes can be activated as follows:

- Press **push buttons 1 and 2** simultaneously for one second  
- Press **push buttons 1 and 3** simultaneously  
- Press each button individually  

Each combination triggers one of the display modes mentioned above.

## Features

- Multiple interactive display modes  
- Easy control using only three push buttons  
- Designed for AVR microcontrollers  
- Demonstrates creative use of LED matrix for dynamic effects
